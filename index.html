				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0"> What is the WBD ?
				</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>WBD or the World Business Dialogue is the world’s largest student run Business Conference organized
						by the students of Cologne University. It is attended by some of the leading Businessmen, Entrepreneurs
						and CEO’s around the world, apart from students of over 70 nationalities.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How do I apply?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Application is a simple process. Please go to https://apply.world-business-dialogue.com and fill up your details, write your essays and voila !</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How will the WBD help me ?
				</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>If you are just looking for a Resume point to help you get jobs, WBD isn’t probably the best option.
						However if you are someone who loves to learn, gain perspective, interact with intellectuals around the
						world and spend time learning cultural differences across the world and how they impact, society,
						industry, business and the world of technology, WBD is the best option you do have ! With participants
						from over 70 countries, you can be rest assured that you will learn a lot in these 5 days. For me
						personally it has been a transformative experience.</p>

			<li class="cd-faq-title"><h2>Funding</h2></li>
			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Is it possible to gain a sponsorship to attend the WBD?
				</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Yes, it is indeed possible to gain a sponsorship. WBD even provides you with a supporting letter for the
						same. However keep in mind that in a country like India, people and companies prefer sponsoring bigger
						causes like rural education, rural healthcare and girl child welfare, and rightly so. However there are still
						a few sources I would recommend you try before you give up: </p>
					<ol type="1">
						<li><p><u>Alumni Association : </u>University alumni associations are surely one of the best ways to look for
						funding. BITSAA and IIT alumni associations are particularly known for this.</p></li>
						<li><p><u>Ministry of Culture : </u>A friend of mine from Orissa once raised sponsorship from Orissa ministry
						of culture. Contact your state or national ministry of culture.</p></li>
						<li><p><u>Corporates : </u>Look for past sponsors of the WBD. In 2015 Bayer provided complete scholarships
						to 6 Pakistani students. Such sponsors might be interested to sponsor you too.</p></li>
						<li><p><u>Universities : </u>While private universities may deny, public universities including the IIT’s and NIT’s
						might be willing to fund a part of your wbd trip !</p></li>
						<li><p><u>Crowdfunding : </u>While I wouldn’t advocate asking complete strangers for money when there are
						far more noble causes, but past delegates have raised money through this.</p></li>

			<li class="cd-faq-title"><h2>Dialogue Project</h2></li>
			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What is a dialogue project ?
				</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Dialogue project represents the true essence of the WBD. It’s the coming together of students and the
						industry. It involves companies hiring students as consultants for solving some of their problems or
						coming up with new ideas. I was a consultant to Fraport AG last year and most of the changes we
						recommended were implemented even before we reached Germany ! Students who are selected for the
						Dialogue project are provided with flight tickets and a free wbd ticket.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0"> Is it worth attending the WBD without the project?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Yes ! Infact in my two years I have attended both with and without. With a project you have
						responsibilities and miss half the conference, while without one you can simply enjoy the conference!
						That being said a project does offer you a sense of purpose and achievement, while not having one
						helps you gain enough time to interact with other students, which is most interesting part of the
						Dialogue.

				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What can I do to get a dialogue project/ What should I write in the essay/ Who selects the
					students for the project ?
				</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>The international relation department of the World Business Dialogue matches students based on
						academic experience and projects to the companies, who then choose the students. For the motivation
						letter, just think how the Dialogue will help you achieve your career goals in the future.
					</p>

			<li class="cd-faq-title"><h2>Costs and Opportunity costs !</h2></li>
			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What is a total estimate of the conference costs ?
				</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Assuming you fly from Delhi/Mumbai/Bangalore, assume 400-500 euros for the flight, 250-300 euros for
						the conference and about 150 euros as miscellaneous expenses including museum tickets, tickets to
						nearby cities like Aachen for travel etc. The conference also includes a city travel pass so all your travel
						in Cologne is free. Also most meals are covered, and the Party of the Nations is even better than what it
						sounds ;)</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0"> Is it helpful for my career ?
				</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Yes, and No. Not if you think having attended the dialogue will straight away get you a job (I have had
						this question far too many times to count !) But the dialogue will imbibe in you a curiosity, a far more
						global perspective, a chance to learn from the brightest minds globally and that means a lot more than
						you can imagine right now.
